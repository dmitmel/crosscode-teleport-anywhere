# Teleport Anywhere!

# This mod is now obsolete and unsupported!!! Please install my other mod instead, [dmitmel's tweak pack](https://github.com/dmitmel/crosscode-tweak-pack#readme).

[![go to the releases page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CCDirectLink/organization/master/assets/badges/releases@2x.png)](https://github.com/dmitmel/crosscode-teleport-anywhere/releases)

Teleport to any map/room in an area or a dungeon simply by clicking it in the map menu.

**Unimportant notice:** This mod is, of course, a cheat, and is intended only for debugging and mod
development purposes. But it's not like I'm gonna prevent you from using it for other purposes :P
